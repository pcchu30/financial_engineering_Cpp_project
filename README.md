# financial_engineering_Cpp_project
In this project, we want to solve a single important financial problem: **How do we compute the price of a portfolio of complex financial products in a bank?** We want to price a portfolio of options using
different pricing methods, such as **Monte Carlo simulation** and closed-form solutions. Since there should be no restrictions on the options that might be in the portfolio, this makes heavy use of
**object-oriented programming** considering scalability and maintainability. We design our own polymorphic classes. These skills we use in this project include object-oriented features of
C++ **(Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism)** and mathematical skills but also include testing, debugging, design, and software architecture. Options are financial instruments that are
derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks.
